            <p class = "synopsisscroll">Ketterdam: a bustling hub of international trade where anything can be had for the right price—and no one knows that better than criminal prodigy Kaz Brekker. Kaz is offered a chance at a deadly heist that could make him rich beyond his wildest dreams. But he can’t pull it off alone. . . .
                <br><br>
                A convict with a thirst for revenge
                <br><br>
                A sharpshooter who can’t walk away from a wager
                <br><br>
                A runaway with a privileged past
                <br><br>
                A spy known as the Wraith
                <br><br>
                A Heartrender using her magic to survive the slums
                <br><br>
                A thief with a gift for unlikely escapes
                <br><br>
                Kaz’s crew is the only thing that might stand between the world and destruction—if they don’t kill each other first.
